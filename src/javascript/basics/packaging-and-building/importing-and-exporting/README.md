#  Modules

> What are modules? Why are they important?

### Requirements

1. Make imports.js import your index.js file. Your index.js should hold the bulk of your code, while imports.js is just a medium in which your code is packaged, and then passed to the test cases.
2. Use the `export` keyword correctly.


### Observations

* Why are modules important? Using what you did to make your code pass, is it possible to make properties inside your classes inaccessible to the public?
* What is the difference from the default and exporting a variable?
* When would you want to export default?  When wouldn't you?
